Cache File Recognizer (V2)
Software that analyzes data and formats it. Each file format are in different folders

This project is powered by the python library fleep, more info can be found here 
DO NOT RUN IT ON YOUR DEKTOP ETC, ALL FILES IN THE DIRECTORY ARE AFFECTED. KEEP EVERYTHING WITIN A FOLDER

Supported file formats can be found here!

This version will ignore all files that are formated correctly (They will stay in the data folder).

How to use:
Start off by downloading the .exe file (or python file if you prefer) (EXE) (PYTHON3.6)

I recommend to create a folder somewhere, place the .exe or .py inside of it

Run your .exe or .py file to generate file-dependencies.

A blue popup should appear, click "show more" and then run anyways (I'm not a verified devoloper by microsoft)

Wait a few seconds while it is working...

Find all of your files that you would like to analyze and patch, place the files (and folders) inside of the data folder

Run the .exe or .py again, wait for the software to analyze your files

The software will output the files in the Results folder, each run got their own folder (counted from 0 and up)

The files should be sorted by file type within different folders (not all of them may work)

Good luck with your file recognition!
