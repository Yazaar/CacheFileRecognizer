<h1>Cache File Recognizer</h1>
<p>Software that analyzes data and formats it. Each file format are in different folders</p>
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/determining-file-format-using-python-c4e7b18d4fc4">This project is powered by the python library fleep, more info can be found here</a>
<br>
<h2>DO NOT RUN IT ON YOUR DEKTOP ETC, ALL FILES IN THE DIRECTORY ARE AFFECTED. KEEP EVERYTHING WITIN A FOLDER</h2>
<br>
<p>Supported file formats can be found <a href="https://github.com/floyernick/fleep-py#supported-formats">here!</a></p>
<br><br>
<h3>How to use:</h3>
<p>Start off by downloading the .exe file (or python file if you prefer) <a href="https://github.com/Yazaar/CacheFileRecognizer/blob/master/converter.exe?raw=true">(EXE)</a> <a href="https://github.com/Yazaar/CacheFileRecognizer/archive/master.zip">(PYTHON3.6)</a></p>
<p>I recommend to create a folder somewhere, place the .exe or .py inside of it</p>
<p>Run your .exe or .py file to generate file-dependencies.</p>
<p>A blue popup should appear, click "show more" and then run anyways (I'm not a verified devoloper by microsoft)</p>
<p>Wait a few seconds while it is working...</p>
<p>Find all of your files that you would like to analyze and patch, place the files (and folders) inside of the data folder</p>
<p>Run the .exe or .py again, wait for the software to analyze your files</p>
<p>The software will output the files in the Results folder, each run got their own folder (counted from 0 and up)</p>
<p>The files should be sorted by file type within different folders (not all of them may work)</p>
<h4>Good luck with your file recognition!</h4>
